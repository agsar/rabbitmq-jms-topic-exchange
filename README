RabbitMQ JMS Topic Exchange Plugin
==================================


Overview
--------

This plugin is designed to work with the JMS Client for RabbitMQ. It supports
JMS Topic routing and selection based on JMS SQL selection rules.

This implementation is based upon the Java Messaging Service Specification
Version 1.1, see http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/docs-136352.html for
a copy of this specification.

Build
-----

Currently this is a RabbitMQ plugin repository which is built by embedding it
in the `rabbitmq-public-umbrella` repository (available from
`www.rabbitmq.com`) and then running `make`. This is a manual process. It is
intended to automate this in future.
